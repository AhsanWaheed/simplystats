<p>The NBA season is over and, once again, what I will most remember are King James’ heroics. As a lifelong Boston Celtics fan, I am supposed to hate LeBron James. But I don’t. As a fan of the game of basketball, and a statistician, I just can’t help but be in awe of the best player ever to play the game. Also how can you hate this guy (don’t miss the wrist watch)?</p>

<p>Of all the ridiculous stats one can rattle about LeBron, to me, the most impressive actually relate to simple one: career totals. The graph below shows you his total points, assists, steals and rebounds as a function of time. The consistency, durability, and all-around production is simply unpresendented. At 33, he is already top 25 <strong>all time</strong> in three categories: points, assists and steals. If he can keep up his current pace for five more years (I know it’s a big <em>if</em>), he will be <strong>top 3</strong> in points, assists and steals, and top 25 in rebounds. No other player comes close.</p>
