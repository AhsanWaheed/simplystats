_Editor's note: This is a personal post, it is about my personal feelings and is not meant to talk about anyone else or to advocate for any particular side of a debate. It is also about a problem that is small in the scheme of internet problems, but is big in my personal life._

I started Simply Statistics about five years ago now. I did it because I saw the explosion of data happening and thought of all the cool things that statisticians and others could do with that data. A little while later my friend Chris V. convinced me to get on Twitter both as a way of keeping in touch with others and as a cool place to discover new ideas. 

Social media has had some incredibly positive effects for me. It has helped me to find people at other institions who think like me, introduced me to the latest R packages, helped me to find papers, and made me feel like I was a part of a community. 

It is worth talking a little bit more about the community that social media and in particular Twitter provides for me. I am an academic biostatistician working at a university and am part of the broader academic statistics community. I know there are tons of posts pointing out all that is wrong with academics, but my experience is that while there are major issues in academia, it is a great place to find people interested in education, public health, and statistics - things I care about deeply.  

But there is a well known challenge in academics that disciplines are often very narrowly focused. There are reasons for this narrow focus - ranging from where the funding for research comes from, historical and cultural reasons, political reasons, and strong philosophical opinions. I have been lucky to be in a fairly flexible academic department. Despite this, it has been challenging to be a "non-standard" (bio)statistcian who is more applied, more interested in building software, more interested in data synthesis, and more interested in non-standard problems like internet education. 

Both at my home institution and in my broader academic community I have sometimes felt I didn't "fit in" because of my research and educational interests. Twitter has been huge for me in that respect. When I felt isolated I could look at what Rafa, Jenny, Karl, Sherri, and others were discussing and feel like "oh I do have a community where I belong". It has also made me feel like I'm part of the broader data science community too - thanks to people like David, Hillary, Hadley, and others. It is not an exaggeration to say that having this community has been _crucial_ for me to feel like I can try new things and not feel like I'm doing the "wrong" thing. The fact that the folks I mentioned above and others in this community are so supportive and helpful is one of best things for our field.

But over the last few months I have found myself increasingly staying off of Twitter and feeling extremely nervous to write blog posts. The reason is that while I belong to a certain community on Twitter, I don't always agree with them on all issues. When I have posted about these topics, I have gotten
